# ESP32 - a compact device for IoT

Currently, the smart home is becoming an increasingly popular and sought-after option for automating home life. With the development of technology there are more and more new innovative solutions for creating a smart home. One such solution is compact devices based on ESP32 microcontroller with Bluetooth support.

The compact ESP32-based devices with Bluetooth support can be used to control various smart home devices such as lights, air conditioners, door locks, etc. Thanks to Bluetooth support, the devices can communicate with each other and with a control device such as a smartphone or tablet.

In addition, compact devices based on ESP32 with Bluetooth support can be easily integrated into the existing smart home infrastructure

So the idea arose to create a compact device that could be placed in an socket in any corner of the house. The basic idea for the creation was projects: [Espresence](https://espresense.com/), and [nuki-hub](https://github.com/technyon/nuki_hub)
